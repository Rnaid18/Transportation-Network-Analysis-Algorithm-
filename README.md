# Transport Road Network Algorithm
#### Assesses the design of a transportation network, 
#### including the connectivity of the transportation network, the shortest distance between two 
#### given intersections in the transportation network, and the shortest distance between all pairs of 
#### intersections in the transportation network. 
#### The transportation network is modelled as a directed weighted graph, where intersections are 
#### represented by vertices, and links between two intersections are represented by edges, and the 
#### distances between a pair of linked intersections is represented by an edge weight.
